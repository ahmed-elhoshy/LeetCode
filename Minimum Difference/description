Given an array of n integers, rearrange them so that the sum of the absolute differences of all adjacent elements is minimized. Then, compute the sum of those absolute differences.

Example
n = 5
arr = [1, 3, 3, 2, 4]

If the list is rearranged as arr' = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], the absolute differences are |1 - 2| = 1, |2 - 3| = 1, |3 - 3| = 0, |3 - 4| = 1.
The sum of those differences is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3.
