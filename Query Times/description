In a high-performance database system of n queries, each query has an execution time represented in the array queryTimes.

To optimize the system, the following tuning operation can be applied:

Select all queries with the same even-number execution time, t, and reduce their execution times to t / 2.

Implement a function that calculates the minimum number of tuning operations required to make all query execution times odd.

The function getMinTuningOperations takes the following parameter:

int queryTimes[n]: an array representing the execution times of queries.

The function should return the minimum number of tuning operations needed to ensure all query execution times are odd.

Example
n = 4
queryTimes = [2, 6, 8, 16]
